## UX

![picture](assets/readme-images/responsive-view.png)

This website is for a gym where the theme is more vintage bodybuilding meets current fitness, to accomplish this images and colours have been selected as black & white greyscale with a solid red to capture attention while not overloading the user with too much information which could distract from signing up to the gym. 

As the website is built to be responsive on smaller devices the navigation bar will shrink to a drop down menu with a hamburger icon.

Across all pages a footer with social links to allow the user to learn more about the gym itself and also contact details.

* Overview - All pages built to be responsive on mobiles, tablets and desktops to fit in with the target demographic as all 3 uses of the website will be expected to be of use.

* Home - The home page is designed to provide a clear call to action to result in people wanting to sign up to the gym while providing basic information about the gym while also looking attractive to the user. - this has been accomplished by using bootstrap features. the main focus point of this page is a jumbotron in the center with basic information of the gym and also a call to action button to insight users to sign up. Below this is a free rotating carousel showing testimonials to postively reassure the user.

* Classes - The Classes page is used to provide information of what classes are available at the gym and their schedule in order to give the user a clear understanding. Basic infomation is displayed about the classes available then below a resposive grid is used to show the days, classes and times in a row on desktop which shrinks to 2 rows on tablet then a singular row on mobile devices to provide clear information to users with a background image also used in contrast to be eye catching but not too overpowering to the user.

* Gallery - The focus of the Gallery page is showing what the gym looks like but also to provide a positive view to the user by showing members of the gym exercising also. This was achieved by use of a bootstrap carousel cycling 3 images with 2 more images below which move from an inline column to a stacked column when moving to smaller devices.

* Contact - The Contact page has been designed to be simple and easy to use to help the user get in contact with the gym with ease to help create a positive view, the form requires basic user information and email data to be submitted so that the gym can respond the user directly and individually to create a better user experience.
